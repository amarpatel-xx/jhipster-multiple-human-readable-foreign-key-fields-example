# JHipster Example for Human-Readable Foreign Keys in User Interface

### About this JHipster Example
This code was generated using the JHipster blueprint `generator-jhipster-multiple-human-readable-foreign-key-fields`. 
The source code for the underlying JHipster generator that is used in this example is available at: https://github.com/amarpatel-xx/generator-jhipster-multiple-human-readable-foreign-key-fields

This code has a JDL which shows 2 foreign keys that will concatenated and shown, in the Angular user interface, in replacement of the UUID. The JDL can be modified and the `@customAnnotation("DISPLAY_IN_GUI_RELATIONSHIP_LINK")` can be used with any fields of an entity which would make it easier to identify that entity when displayed (as part of a relationship). Sometimes having a UUID makes it difficult for the human in the loop to figure out what the entity on a relationship's other side actually is. If multiple entity fields are necessary to replace the UUID, the fields can be delimmited via a specified delimiter using a `@customAnnotation`, as well (see the example JDL file included as part of this project).

Matt Raible's frequently used the blog and store examples in his capability demonstrations.
1.  Below is the example using the \@customAnnotation and specifying the
    delimiter also.
```shell
    entity Blog {
      @customAnnotation("DISPLAY_IN_GUI_RELATIONSHIP_LINK") @customAnnotation("-") name String required minlength(3)
      @customAnnotation("DISPLAY_IN_GUI_RELATIONSHIP_LINK") @customAnnotation("-") handle String required minlength(2)
    }

    entity Post {
      title String required
      content TextBlob required
      date Instant required
    }

    relationship ManyToOne {
      Blog{user(login)} to User
      Post{blog} to Blog
    }
```

## Prerequisites:

- https://sdkman.io/[Java] 21+
- https://nodejs.com/[Node.js] 20+
- https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/[Docker Desktop]
- https://www.jhipster.tech/installation/[JHipster] 8.6.0

### Build
### Build Java Microservices using the Multiple Human-readable Foreign Key Fields Blueprint 

1.  To generate a microservices architecture with human-readable foreign key fields support, run the following command:
```shell
npm install -g generator-jhipster-multiple-human-readable-foreign-key-fields
sh generate-code.sh
```

2.  You should see the message:
```shell
Congratulations, JHipster execution is complete!
```

### Run your Multiple Human-readable Foreign Key Fields Example 

1.  When the process is complete, cd into the `gateway` directory and start Keycloak and Eureka using Docker Compose.
```shell
cd gateway
docker compose -f src/main/docker/keycloak.yml up -d
docker compose -f src/main/docker/jhipster-registry.yml up -d
```

2.  Start `gateway` database with Docker by opening a terminal and navigating to its directory and running the Docker command. Then start the `gateway` by running the Maven command.
```shell
npm run docker:db:up
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

3.  Start `blog` database with Docker by opening a terminal and navigating to its directory and running the Docker command. Then, start the `blog` microservice.
```shell
cd blog
npm run docker:db:up
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

4.  Start `store` database with Docker by opening a terminal and navigating to its directory and running the Docker command. Then, start the `store` microservice.
```shell
cd store
npm run docker:db:up
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

### Switch Identity Providers

JHipster ships with Keycloak when you choose OAuth 2.0 / OIDC as the authentication type.

If you'd like to use Okta for your identity provider, see [JHipster's documentation](https://www.jhipster.tech/security/#okta).

## You can configure JHipster quickly with the [Okta CLI](https://cli.okta.com):
```shell
okta apps create jhipster
```

### See the Code in Action

Now you can open your favorite browser to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080), and log in with the credentials displayed on the page.

## Then create a Blog
1.  Open your favorite browser to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080), and log in with the credentials displayed on the page.
2.  Then, add a blog by giving it a name, handle and selecting a user.
3.  Add a tag by giving it a name.

4.  Finally, create a post by giving it a title, content, selecting a blog and a tag.


Notice the Blog column shows `<blog-name>-<blog-handle>` and not the UUID of the blog. That is success!

## Have Fun with Micro Frontends and JHipster!


I hope you enjoyed this demo, and it helped you understand how to build better microservice architectures with human-readable foreign key fields.
