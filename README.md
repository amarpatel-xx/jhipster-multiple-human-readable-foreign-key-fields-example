# JHipster Example for Human-Readable Foreign Keys in User Interface
:::

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: {#content}
:::::::::::: {#preamble}
::::::::::: sectionbody
::: paragraph
This code was generated using the JHipster blueprint
\"generator-jhipster-multiple-human-readable-foreign-key-fields\" (the
source code is available at:
[https://github.com/amarpatel-xx/generator-jhipster-multiple-human-readable-foreign-key-fields](https://github.com/amarpatel-xx/generator-jhipster-multiple-human-readable-foreign-key-fields){.bare}).
This code has a JDL which shows 2 foreign keys that will concatenated
and shown, in the Angular user interface, in replacement of the UUID.
The JDL can be modified and the
\@customAnnotation(\"DISPLAY_IN_GUI_RELATIONSHIP_LINK\") can be used
with any fields of an entity which would make it easier to identify that
entity when displayed (as part of a relationship). Sometimes having a
UUID makes it difficult for the human in the loop to figure out what the
entity on a relationship's other side actually is. If multiple entity
fields are necessary to replace the UUID, the fields can be delimmited
via a specified delimiter using a \@customAnnotation, as well (see the
example JDL file included as part of this project).

1.  Below is the example using the \@customAnnotation and specifying the
    delimiter also.
:::

:::: listingblock

    entity Blog {
      @customAnnotation("DISPLAY_IN_GUI_RELATIONSHIP_LINK") @customAnnotation("-") name String required minlength(3)
      @customAnnotation("DISPLAY_IN_GUI_RELATIONSHIP_LINK") @customAnnotation("-") handle String required minlength(2)
    }

    entity Post {
      title String required
      content TextBlob required
      date Instant required
    }

    relationship ManyToOne {
      Blog{user(login)} to User
      Post{blog} to Blog
    }

## Build Java Microservices using the Multiple Human-readable Foreign Key Fields Blueprint {#_build_java_microservices_using_the_multiple_human_readable_foreign_key_fields_blueprint}

:::: sectionbody
::: {.olist .arabic}
1.  To generate a microservices architecture with human-readable foreign
    key fields support, run the following command:

    :::: listingblock
    ::: content
    ``` {.highlightjs .highlight}
    npm install -g generator-jhipster-multiple-human-readable-foreign-key-fields
    sh generate-code.sh
    ```
    :::
    ::::

2.  You should see the message:

    :::: listingblock
    ::: content
    ``` {.highlightjs .highlight}
    Congratulations, JHipster execution is complete!
    ```

## Run your Multiple Human-readable Foreign Key Fields Example {#_run_your_multiple_human_readable_foreign_key_fields_example}

:::: sectionbody
::: {.olist .arabic}
1.  When the process is complete, cd into the `gateway` directory and
    start Keycloak and Eureka using Docker Compose.

    :::: listingblock
    ::: content
    ``` {.highlightjs .highlight}
    cd gateway
    docker compose -f src/main/docker/keycloak.yml up -d
    docker compose -f src/main/docker/jhipster-registry.yml up -d
    ```
    :::
    ::::

2.  Start `gateway` database with Docker by opening a terminal and
    navigating to its directory and running the Docker command. Then
    start the `gateway` by running the Maven command.

    :::: listingblock
    ::: content
    ``` {.highlightjs .highlight}
    npm run docker:db:up
    ./mvnw spring-boot:run
    ```
    :::
    ::::

3.  Start `blog` database with Docker by opening a terminal and
    navigating to its directory and running the Docker command. Then,
    start the `blog` microservice.

    :::: listingblock
    ::: content
    ``` {.highlightjs .highlight}
    cd blog
    npm run docker:db:up
    ./mvnw spring-boot:run
    ```
    :::
    ::::

4.  Start `store` database with Docker by opening a terminal and
    navigating to its directory and running the Docker command. Then,
    start the `store` microservice.

    :::: listingblock
    ::: content
    ``` {.highlightjs .highlight}
    cd store
    npm run docker:db:up
    ./mvnw spring-boot:run
    ```

## Switch Identity Providers {#_switch_identity_providers}

:::::: sectionbody
::: paragraph
JHipster ships with Keycloak when you choose OAuth 2.0 / OIDC as the
authentication type.
:::

::: paragraph
If you'd like to use Okta for your identity provider, see [JHipster's
documentation](https://www.jhipster.tech/security/#okta).

Then create a Blog

::: {.olist .arabic}
1.  Open your favorite browser to
    [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080){.bare}, and log in
    with the credentials displayed on the page.

2.  Then, add a blog by giving it a name, handle and selecting a user.

3.  Add a tag by giving it a name.

4.  Finally, create a post by giving it a title, content, selecting a
    blog and a tag.
:::

::: paragraph
Notice the Blog column shows \<blog-name\>-\<blog-handle\> and not the
UUID of the blog. That is success!
