= JHipster Example for Human-Readable Foreign Keys in User Interface

This code was generated using the JHipster blueprint "generator-jhipster-multiple-human-readable-foreign-key-fields" (the source code is available at: https://github.com/amarpatel-xx/generator-jhipster-multiple-human-readable-foreign-key-fields).  This code has a JDL which shows 2 foreign keys that will concatenated and shown, in the Angular user interface, in replacement of the UUID.  The JDL can be modified and the @customAnnotation("DISPLAY_IN_GUI_RELATIONSHIP_LINK") can be used with any fields of an entity which would make it easier to identify that entity when displayed (as part of a relationship). Sometimes having a UUID makes it difficult for the human in the loop to figure out what the entity on a relationship's other side actually is. If multiple entity fields are necessary to replace the UUID, the fields can be delimmited via a specified delimiter using a @customAnnotation, as well (see the example JDL file included as part of this project).

. Below is the example using the @customAnnotation and specifying the delimiter also.
[source,shell]
----
entity Blog {
  @customAnnotation("DISPLAY_IN_GUI_RELATIONSHIP_LINK") @customAnnotation("-") name String required minlength(3)
  @customAnnotation("DISPLAY_IN_GUI_RELATIONSHIP_LINK") @customAnnotation("") handle String required minlength(2)
}

entity Post {
  title String required
  content TextBlob required
  date Instant required
}

relationship ManyToOne {
  Blog{user(login)} to User
  Post{blog} to Blog
}

=== Build Java Microservices using the Multiple Human-readable Foreign Key Fields Blueprint

. To generate a microservices architecture with human-readable foreign key fields support, run the following command:
+
[source,shell]
----
sh generate-code-non-reactive-mf.sh
----

. You should see the message:
+
[source,shell]
----
Run `npm audit` for details.
Congratulations, JHipster execution is complete!
Sponsored with ‚ù§Ô∏è  by @oktadev.
----

=== Run your Multiple Human-readable Foreign Key Fields Example

. When the process is complete, cd into the `gateway` directory and start Keycloak and Eureka using Docker Compose.
+
[source,shell]
----
cd gateway
docker compose -f src/main/docker/keycloak.yml up -d
docker compose -f src/main/docker/jhipster-registry.yml up -d
----
+
. Start `gateway` database with Docker by opening a terminal and navigating to its directory and running the Docker command. Then start the `gateway` by running the Maven command.
+
[source,shell]
----
npm run docker:db:up
./mvnw spring-boot:run
----

. Open your favorite browser to `\http://localhost:8080`, and log in with the credentials displayed on the page.

. Show missing links in entities menu.

. Start `blog` database with Docker by opening a terminal and navigating to its directory and running the Docker command. Then start the `gateway` by running the Maven command.
+
[source,shell]
----
npm run docker:db:up
./mvnw spring-boot:run
----

. Open a new terminal and do the same for the `store` microservice.

. Verify everything is started using Eureka at `\http://localhost:8761`.

. Refresh the gateway app to see menu items.

. To make Keycloak work, you must add the following line to your hosts file (`/etc/hosts` on Mac/Linux, `c:\Windows\System32\Drivers\etc\hosts` on Windows).
+
----
127.0.0.1  keycloak
----

. Prove everything works at `\http://localhost:8500`

. Run Cypress e2e tests:
+
[source,shell]
----
npm run e2e -ws
----

== Switch identity providers

JHipster ships with Keycloak when you choose OAuth 2.0 / OIDC as the authentication type.

If you'd like to use Okta for your identity provider, see https://www.jhipster.tech/security/#okta[JHipster's documentation].

[TIP]
====
You can configure JHipster quickly with the https://cli.okta.com[Okta CLI]:
[source,shell]
----
okta apps create jhipster

== Have fun with Micro Frontends and JHipster!

I hope you enjoyed this demo, and it helped you understand how to build better microservice architectures with micro frontends.
