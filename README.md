## JHipster Example for Composite Primary Keys in Cassandra

### About this JHipster Example

This code was generated using the JHipster blueprint `generator-jhipster-cassandra-composite-primary-key`. 
The source code for the underlying JHipster blueprint is available at: https://github.com/amarpatel-xx/generator-jhipster-cassandra-composite-primary-key.

The blueprint for generating the composite primary key with Cassandra entities is open source software made with love by `Amar Premsaran Patel`.

This code in this example has a JDL which shows 2 Cassandra entities that have composite primary keys and 3 Cassandra entities that have single-value primary keys. The example entities in the JDL is based on

Matt Raible's frequently used the blog and store examples in his capability demonstrations.

The current blueprint only supports a single field of type PrimaryKeyType.PARTITIONED; a field which is the partition column is specified as such with the `@customAnnotation("PrimaryKeyType.PARTITIONED")` custom annotation. In the future, the blueprint can be modified to support multiple fields with PrimaryKeyType.PARTITIONED types. Nevertheless, if a entity needs to specify additional fields with type `PrimaryKeyType.CLUSTERED`, they are specified using `@customAnnotation("PrimaryKeyType.CLUSTERED")`. There are no relationships between Cassandra entities, as such relationships cannot be specified. The blueprint also support the Cassandra type `CassandraType.Name.SET`.

Below is the example using the \@customAnnotation methodology to specify the details of the Cassandra composite primary key. Also, below is an example of a single-value primary key entity.
```
    // Composite Primary Key Example:
    entity Post {
      @Id @customAnnotation("PrimaryKeyType.PARTITIONED") @customAnnotation("CassandraType.Name.BIGINT") @customAnnotation("UTC_DATE") @customAnnotation("0") createdDate Long
      // Do not name composite primary key fields as 'id' as it conflicts with the 'id' field in the JHipster entity.
      @customAnnotation("PrimaryKeyType.CLUSTERED") @customAnnotation("CassandraType.Name.BIGINT") @customAnnotation("UTC_DATETIME") @customAnnotation("1") addedDateTime Long
      @customAnnotation("PrimaryKeyType.CLUSTERED") @customAnnotation("CassandraType.Name.UUID") @customAnnotation("") @customAnnotation("2") postId UUID
      @customAnnotation("") @customAnnotation("CassandraType.Name.TEXT") @customAnnotation("") @customAnnotation("") title String required
      @customAnnotation("") @customAnnotation("CassandraType.Name.TEXT") @customAnnotation("") @customAnnotation("") content String required
    }

    // Single-value Primary Key Example:
    entity Product {
      // Primary Key field can be named 'id'.  JHipster natively supports single-value primary keys.  This blueprint also supports single-value primary keys.
      @Id @customAnnotation("PrimaryKeyType.PARTITIONED") @customAnnotation("CassandraType.Name.UUID") @customAnnotation("") @customAnnotation("") id UUID
      @customAnnotation("") @customAnnotation("CassandraType.Name.TEXT") @customAnnotation("") @customAnnotation("") title String required
      @customAnnotation("") @customAnnotation("CassandraType.Name.DECIMAL") @customAnnotation("") @customAnnotation("") price BigDecimal required min(0)
      @customAnnotation("") @customAnnotation("CassandraType.Name.BLOB") @customAnnotation("image") @customAnnotation("") image ImageBlob
      @customAnnotation("") @customAnnotation("CassandraType.Name.DATE") @customAnnotation("") @customAnnotation("") addedDate LocalDate required
      @customAnnotation("") @customAnnotation("CassandraType.Name.BIGINT") @customAnnotation("UTC_DATETIME") @customAnnotation("") addedDateTime Long
    }
```

## Prerequisites:

- https://sdkman.io/[Java] 21+

- https://www.jhipster.tech/installation/[JHipster] 8.6.0

### Build

Build Java Microservices using the Cassandra Composite Primary Key Blueprint

### Build Java Microservices using the Cassandra Composite Primary Key Blueprint

1. To generate a microservices architecture with Cassandra composite primary key support, run the following command:
```shell
npm install -g generator-jhipster-cassandra-composite-primary-key

sh saathratri-generate-code-dev-cassandra.sh
```

 2. You should see the message:
```shell
Congratulations, JHipster execution is complete!
```

### Run your Cassandra Composite Primary Key Entities Example

1.  When the process is complete, cd into the `gateway` directory and start Keycloak and Eureka using Docker Compose.
```shell
cd gateway
docker compose -f src/main/docker/keycloak.yml up -d
docker compose -f src/main/docker/jhipster-registry.yml up -d
```

2.  Start `gateway` database with Docker by opening a terminal and navigating to its directory and running the Docker command. Then start the `gateway` by running the Maven command.
```shell
npm run docker:db:up
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

3.  Start `blog` database with Docker by opening a terminal and navigating to its directory and running the Docker command. Then, start the `blog` microservice.
```shell
cd blog
npm run docker:db:up
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

4.  Start `store` database with Docker by opening a terminal and navigating to its directory and running the Docker command. Then, start the `store` microservice.
```shell
cd store
npm run docker:db:up
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

### Switch Identity Providers

JHipster ships with Keycloak when you choose OAuth 2.0 / OIDC as the authentication type.

If you'd like to use Okta for your identity provider, see [JHipster's documentation](https://www.jhipster.tech/security/#okta).

## You can configure JHipster quickly with the [Okta CLI](https://cli.okta.com):
```shell
okta apps create jhipster
```

### See the Code in Action

Now you can open your favorite browser to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080), and log in with the credentials displayed on the page.

## Then create a Blog
1.  Open your favorite browser to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080), and log in with the credentials displayed on the page.
2.  Then, add a blog by giving it a name, handle and selecting a user.
3.  Add a tag by giving it a name.
4.  Finally, create a post by giving it a title, content, selecting a blog and a tag.


Notice the Blog entity shows the required category and blogId composite primary key fields. That is success!

## Have Fun with Micro Frontends and JHipster!

I hope you enjoyed this demo, and it helped you understand how to build better microservice architectures with composite primary keys.
